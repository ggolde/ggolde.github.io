<h1>Hello, I am Griffin Golde</h1>
<p>This website is hosted with GitHub Pages. I am using it to show all of the Shiny Apps I have built for the University of Florida's Department of Nuerology's paper: "Microglia show differential transcriptomic response to Aβ peptide aggregates ex vivo and in vivo".</br> Abstract: Aggregation and accumulation of Aβ is a defining feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Genetic, pathological and modeling studies strongly implicate that microglial responses to Aβ play a central role in AD pathogenesis. We compared the transcriptomic responses between primary mouse microglia in culture following the application of Aβ42 peptide and amyloid depositing transgenic mice. For the ex vivo studies we applied exogenous Aβ peptide, either in a primarily oligomeric or fibrillar conformation, to primary mouse microglial cultures and evaluated system level transcriptional changes.  Transcriptional changes were then compared to brain transcriptomic data derived from transgenic CRND8 APP mice and non-transgenic littermate controls at 3, 6, 12 and 20 months of age. Notably, transcriptional responses to oligomer or fibrillar forms of Aβ, though partially overlapping, are distinct.  However, transcriptional responses to Aβ in the primary microglia do not faithfully model expression changes observed in microglial genes in the transgenic CRND8 mouse brain as Aβ progressively accumulates.  Many classic immune mediators that have been intensively studies in the context of AD and AD models show massive transcriptional changes in the primary microglial cultures, but these changes are not observed in the mouse model. These data extend previous studies that have demonstrated that microglia responses ex vivo are poor proxies for in vivo responses and help explain some of the historical focus on select immune molecules which show dramatic upregulation in primary culture but not in vivo. Finally, these data demonstrate the potential utility of using microglia as biosensors of different aggregate conformation, as the transcriptional responses to oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ can be distinguished.</p>
